# About Me
**Morgan Ivn'z Hester**
**Paterson, NJ, Passaic County**
**Aspiring IT professional with a strong interest in cybersecurity and a growing foundation in technology. While I’m early in my formal experience, I’ve spent time independently learning about computers, networks, and digital security. I’m committed to developing my skills through hands-on practice, training, and real-world application, with a focus on continuous growth in the IT field.**
**After completing my cybersecurity course, my goal is to begin a career in the cybersecurity field with a focus on protecting systems and data from threats. I’m particularly interested in entry-level roles such as Security Analyst, IT Support Specialist, or SOC (Security Operations Center) Analyst, where I can apply what I’ve learned while continuing to grow.**
**I’m proud of helping a friend troubleshoot and fix their Wi-Fi and device connection issues. It might seem small, but it gave me the confidence to problem-solve, follow steps logically, and realize that I enjoy working with technology—one of the things that sparked my interest in IT and cybersecurity.**
